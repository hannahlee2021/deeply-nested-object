description: for this project, i am going to explore my relationship with my habit of pulling out my hair. this is considered a medical condition known as trichotillomania, and it is something i have grappled with since i was 11 years old. within this project, i would like to delve into not just tracking the times i pull out my hair, but i would also like to account for the events/mood that drove me to pulling as well as the emotions i feel during and after the moment.

research layout

1. instances of hair pulling 
	- take note of the times when each moment occurs as well as duration 
	- compile everything daily to note number of instances in a day
	- take note of consistencies
2. emotions [before]
	- what led to my hands going to my head and pulling
	- take note of consistencies

	- are there feelings of instant gratification?
	- take note of consistencies
